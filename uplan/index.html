      <p><strong>uPlan</strong>, <em>verb</em>: the act of verbally telling uPlan what tasks you want completed as part of a project.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Why: Live your life</h2>
      <p>To facilitate the lifestyle you want and to achieve your goals by completing complex projects on your behalf. uPlan exists to remove operational friction so you can focus on strategy, relationships, and the life you wish to live.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How: uPlan, I do</h2>
      <p>Start by defining the project you want to complete — this might be launching a startup, planning a trip, or sourcing and buying assets. The process is designed to be simple and voice-driven.</p>

      <ul class="plain">
        <li>You define the project.</li>
        <li>You speak into a voice recorder to define the tasks that make up the project; the more detail, the better.</li>
        <li>uPlan generates an even more detailed plan (called a uPlan) in a strict, correctly sequenced format.</li>
        <li>You review the detailed plan, consult AI and subject matter experts as desired, and edit the contents.</li>
        <li>When the uPlan meets your approval, the uPlan system executes the tasks in fully automated fashion.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Where: Remote-only</h2>
      <p>uPlan operates remotely. It can only complete tasks that remote workers (freelancers, contractors, remote services) can perform. The system coordinates remote labor and automation to deliver outcomes without requiring a physical on-site presence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> When: Work 1680 hours a week</h2>
      <p>Each uPlan instance can work up to 168 hours per week. By running multiple uPlan instances concurrently you can scale capacity — for example, ten instances scale toward 1,680 hours per week of automated and semi-automated effort.</p>

      <p>All core components of uPlan are operational now; however, three known issues remain and are scheduled to be fixed by October.</p>
