<pre>Neo, [1]

"Allow me to re-introduce myself" 
Public Service Announcement - Jay Z

For years, I competed against step teams as a solo performer.
Since I look a bit Lawrence Fishburn, I acted as "Morpheus".

Reintroduction:
    "Welcome Neo, I am Morpheus . . ."

Why is that important?
Because Morpheus felt it was his purpose to find THE ONE. ;)

You have already convinced me that you're THEONE for me.
Below, I will explain exactly why.

But, first, I need you to teach me how to solve a problem.

The Problem:
You are extremely attractive, educated, and have a sweet voice.
You're clearly articulate, ambitious, and have achieved a lot.

Therefore, there is a very high probability that you have a 
high quantity of men persuing you because most men, like me,
find you extremely attractive.

However, you still decided to pay for PREMIUM on one of the
worst dating sites in existence! LOL

I deduce that while you are likely getting a high quantity
of interested men, you are not getting the _quality_ that
you seek . . . and deserve.

The Solution:
Please provide a detailed list what you're looking for in a mate.
I have such a list written and can share it with you.
This way, I can see what qualities you are searching for and
make sure I am qualified. 

Simple, right?

Proposal
Next, I'd love you to allow me to be arrogant for awhile.
I believe I am uniquely qualified to be "THEONE" for you.

Coincidentally, I am nearly done developing a new system.
The system will allow you to further your career and work
"in a collaborative environment in workforce management".

It is called "uPlan"
Here's how it works:

. You consult with the client/company
. You do the requirements gathering just like this:
    "If I were a virtual assistant, what tasks do you want completed"
  Optionally, you can just gather any requirements the client has
. You record the conversation and use GenAI to convert it to text.
. The system I am developing will write a detailed project "uPlan".

uPlan format:
project: what: how: why: where: when:  who: 
    phase: what: how: why: where: when: who: 
        stage: what: how: why: where: when: who: 
            task: what: how: why: where: when: who: 

Here is a very rough draft of a uPlan that I wrote (by hand).
It includes setting up and configuring a CRM, business admin,
marketing, sales, and customer support. It is written in a 
modular way so that it can be used in different industries.

Module Manual
<a href=https://github.com/codecartelcodes/ModuleManual/blob/main/phase.uplan.md target=_blank>Phase View</a>

<a href=https://github.com/codecartelcodes/ModuleManual/blob/main/stage.uplan.md target=_blank>Phase and Stage View</a>

<a href=https://github.com/codecartelcodes/ModuleManual/blob/main/modulemanual.uplan.md target=_blank>Phase, Stage, and Task View</a>

As you can see, it is simply todo lists inside todo lists.
The detailed context is set for every individual task.

Once it is in this detailed format, I can transpose the text
and reformat it however you like. And, I can even develop a
way to import the output into your favorite project management
systems.

Writing like that is tedius, but it gives the full context on
each concept. It is clear, concise, and I have tested to make
sure it actually works!

Of course, I know it is tedious to write that way, so I will
simply automate it where my system will write in that style.

Moreover, I have a background in finance and can do things like
automatically generate reports based on financial calculations.
And, I can use the same exact tool to write financial software.

I am planning to pitch the uPlan business concept at the ATDC
at GATech on Friday.

So, as you can see, I am arrogantly offering this whole plan
based on your preferred career path (before our call).

Why?
Art.

My mind:
My mind can take infatuation, attraction, and lust and convert
it into code or find "genius" ideas in abstract and theoretical
areas. If I am attracted enough, it just starts brainstorming.

I have written insane financial algorithms based on this mode.
I can share the algorithms with you (in extremely simple math).
In essence, I try to prove my love by creating innovative art.

I'm sure that you will inspire me and the result will be great!
I have found that I can afford to be overconfident in this way.

The Other Problem
On the other hand, I will seem less emotionally available for
the next 30 days. I am currently in a state of hyperfocus where
I am "going to the next level". I can demonstrate what I'm able
to do so far. It's just that I'm going to have to grind hard.

FOMO
I have a fear of missing out (FOMO) that you will get snatched
up within the month. I would have to rely on the hope that you
will not find the qualities in a man that you are looking for.

Risk:
Nonetheless, if we spend the next 30 days getting to know each
other, I can prove that I can deliver on what I described above.
I'm an artist; The art is always worth the sacrifice and risk.

Well, you can't have a proposal without a call to action:
Please consider getting to know me and defining the things you
want over the next 30 days. During that time, I will develop
infrastructure to automate various aspects of project managment.
You can give your feedback and I will customize it for you.

That way, if after 30 days, you're not interested in more,
at least you will have a new valuable tool to help you through
life. Likewise, I will end up developing a more valuable tool.

Sincerely,
Morpheus ;)

Footnotes:
[1]
"Neo" is an anagram for "One", as in "THEONE".
It is just a little profile username pun. LOL [2]

[2]
Of course, there should only be ONE footnote labeled "[1]"
Doh!

P.S.
What's it called when you aren't in my life?
Guess first, then scroll down for the puchline . . .





















"No Didi"
Too soon?





What do I want to eat for dinner?
Guess first . . . then scroll





















SALAd.
Too soon?
Forgive me.





Another one I just thought.
"You be the Goddess; I'll be a god. Let's work on Creation."
