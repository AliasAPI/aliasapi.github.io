  <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Detailed Description of Drew</h2>
  <p>Drew's primary mode of living is focused externally, where he takes things in primarily via his intuition. His secondary mode is internal, where he deals with things rationally and logically.</p>
  <p>With Extraverted Intuition dominating his personality, Drew's primary interest in life is understanding the world and sussing out possibilities in it. He is constantly absorbing ideas and images about the situations presented in his life. Using his intuition to process this information, Drew is usually extremely quick and accurate in his ability to size up a situation. With the exception of his ENFP cousin, Drew has a deeper understanding of his environment than any of the other types.</p>
  <p>This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts Drew at a distinct advantage in life. He generally understands things quickly and with great depth. Accordingly, Drew is quite flexible and adapts well to a wide range of tasks. He is good at most anything that interests him. As he grows and further develops his intuitive abilities and insights, Drew becomes very aware that exciting possibilities exist all around him.</p>
  <p>Drew is an idea person. His perceptive abilities cause him to see possibilities everywhere. He gets excited and enthusiastic about his ideas and is able to spread that enthusiasm to others. In this way, he gets the support needed to fulfill his visions.</p>
  <p>Drew is less interested in developing plans of action or making decisions than he is in generating possibilities and ideas. Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore. For Drew, this sometimes results in a habit of never finishing what he starts. When Drew has not developed his Thinking process, he may enthusiastically jump from idea to idea without following through. He needs to take care to think through his ideas fully in order to take advantage of them.</p>
  <p>Drew's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking drives his decision-making process. Although Drew is more interested in absorbing information than in making decisions, he is quite rational and logical when reaching conclusions. When he applies Thinking to his Intuitive perceptions, the outcome can be very powerful. A well-developed Drew is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising in his quest for uncovering truth in the world around him.</p>
  <p>Drew is a fluent conversationalist, mentally quick, and enjoys verbal sparring with others. He loves to debate issues and may even switch sides sometimes just for the love of debate. When expressing his underlying principles, however, Drew may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.</p>
  <p>This personality style is sometimes referred to as the "lawyer type," someone who quickly and accurately understands a situation and objectively and logically acts upon it using their auxiliary Introverted Thinking function. If Drew were tasked with defending someone who committed a crime, he might take advantage of quirks in the law to get his client off the hook. If he actually won the case, he would see his actions as completely fair and proper to the situation because they were lawful—the guilt or innocence of the client would be less relevant. If this type of reasoning goes completely unchecked, Drew may be perceived by others as unethical or dishonest. Because he does not naturally consider the personal, human element in decision-making, Drew should take care to notice the subjective side of situations. This is a potential problem area for someone like Drew. Although his logical abilities lend strength and purpose, they may also isolate him from his feelings and from the social empathy of the culture in which he lives.</p>
  <p>The least developed area for Drew is Sensing. He may struggle with taking care of the details of life. Conversely, under stress, Drew may lose his ability to generate possibilities and become obsessed with minor details. These details may seem extremely important at the time, but usually are not. When the stress fades, the obsession with details will fade as well.</p>
  <p>In general, Drew is an upbeat visionary. He highly values knowledge and spends much of his life seeking a higher understanding. Drew lives in a world of possibilities and becomes excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties. When presented with a problem, he is good at improvising and quickly comes up with a creative solution. Creative, clever, fun, curious, and theoretical, Drew has a broad range of possibilities in life.</p>

His past is merely a springboard; he rarely lingers in yesterday when tomorrow holds something unexplored. He thrives on impact, innovation, and the thrill of what could be.</p>
