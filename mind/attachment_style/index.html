The test is complete, it scores you along two scales (scores are between one and five):

Your score for avoidance was 2.1, this personality trait is related to how much you are unwilling to allow yourself to be vulnerable to your partner. High scorers do not like to open up to others. Low scorers share their feelings freely.
Your score for anxiety was 3.4, this personality trait is related to how much you worry about your partner paying attention to you. People who score high on this trait frequently worry about, and are dissatisfied with, the attention they recive. Low scorers tend not to worry about this.

Your two scores can be plotted to yield your "attachment style", see the chart below.
