Once upon a time I was a go, I was dating a lady and our relationship was going bad. So one day I happened to be talking to her daughter and her daughter described the mother's behavior as being very interested in projects and then losing interest and then gaining interest again and she also explained that the mother did the same thing in relationships where she would get very attracted to a particular man, lose interest and possibly gain interest again, either in that man or some other man. So from that insight I was able to create a graph of her mother's behavior. On one hand you have the left side which are behaviors that lead to poverty and short-term relationships and on the right hand there are behaviors that lead to being a self-made millionaire and having long-term committed relationships. So once I had that model I was able to make a list of behavior patterns that would either go towards the right or towards the left and all of us un-delete or swing back and forth between these two sides in our day-to-day behaviors. So after I did that and figured that model out I decided to brainstorm or overthink what qualities I want in a woman and obviously I would want the qualities that were listed on the right. So I decided to get on the dating sites and make my brand the thing, the values and principles that I stood for to be Mr. Right, meaning the right side of the graph and I'm looking for Mrs. Right, someone who also wants to go towards being self-made millionaire and a long-term committed relationship as opposed to a short-term relationship and poverty. So as I was coming up with the attributes of the lady that I thought would be the most desirable I decided to rely a little bit on pop science which in the Myers-Briggs and personality profiling tests. And I determined that I would most likely want to be with an INTJ in the Myers-Briggs personality type. So after I did that I decided to write out attributes of the INTJ and I also thought about every lady I ever dated and the things that I liked in those ladies and what I discovered was a pattern that not only was I describing an INTJ but that the adjectives that describe the lady all could be beginning with the letter A. So ambitious, administrative, a little bit argumentative, attractive, affectionate and so the list goes on. So because I liked to overthink in brainstorm I decided that I must describe the lady of my dreams only using adjectives in using that start with the letter A and I ended up with a list of over 140 of these attributes. So I started to write this out as sales copy so underneath that you have the INTJ pattern and then layered on top of that are all these adjectives that begin with the letter A and then I wanted it to write it in the style that really sounds salesy or the add copy style or the advertising style and write a letter describing what I wanted in a lady and then hopefully some lady would read that and see their reflection that they are like this thing, this these attributes that they have the attributes that I'm listing and filter off or turn off all the ladies that don't have these attributes. After I came up with the list and it got to about 140 I started dating INTJs who are ladies in real life and I would give them the list of adjectives that begin with A's and I would say go through this list and tell me which of these attributes do describe you and which ones don't and when they would go through the list they would mark off the ones that did not describe them and in there I got terms like affectionate so I had a list of about 10 to 12 of these A attributes that did not describe the INTJs that I was going on dates with but I wanted those attributes even if I wasn't finding it in the specific lady. One day I realized I did more and more research on this psychological pop science Myers-Briggs and I got into other types of personality tests like Enneagram and by digging deeper into that psychology what I discovered next was that when my personality which can be described as an ENTP is under stress it converts or transposes into more of INTJ behaviors so in other words when I'm under stress I'll be more introverted rely on my intuition logic and I become more practical under stress so that gave me the understanding the new insight that I had was that what I was looking for in a mate was someone I could rely on when I'm under stress somebody that can help me through the tough times and I realized that the sum total of this INTJ that is also affectionate and has all these other qualities that the INTJs were saying did not describe them I have those attributes so I personally found that I was literally trying to find Mrs. Wright by marrying like almost like a subconscious behavior pattern that kicks in to save my ass when I'm in times of stress so I really wanted an ambitious and ascidious a very reliable life partner so that we can achieve greater things together because I can rely on somebody that can help carry the load for the very ambitious goals that I'm trying to achieve so I found Mrs. Wright but she was already in my own head or already part of my psychology so that's how I found Mrs. Wright moving on into the future I ended up not marrying Mrs. Wright I had other relationships and during those relationships I still kind of longed for Mrs. Wright so being a software developer just out of coincidence large language models or generative AI came along into existence so chat GBT came into existence but it did so coincidentally I was working on a project to fully automate managing developers in India there are several there's lots of problems with managing those for people or the teams in India and so I created this software virtual computer and it was called a Docker container and I put a bunch of quality assurance tools in the Docker container that would run automatically if they type a command and then I would also give them fake code or pseudo code that's written the logic is written but it looks closer to plain English and so given them the pseudo code and then giving them the QA tool and giving them the development environment they could write the code and then run a command that I already pre-configured that would check the code and tell them what to fix line by line and actually walk them through that entire project well once I got that working I discovered chat GBT about three months later and after I had started building this tool to manage software developers and what I discovered was that I could basically feed the pseudo code to a generative AI system or a large language model and it would write the correct code write the correct syntax and give me that as an output and what that means is that I could replace the human software developers with large language models or generative AI because I was already providing the pseudo code and now I had a way to automatically do quality assurance so I built this whole system together but it goes worse so there's the next level up was that I was trying to train people business administration marketing sales customer support and a little bit illegal and the financial modeling and so I created a system called the module manual where it had a project broken into phases stages and tasks and each of those phases stages and tasks and the project itself was described with sentences related to what how why where when and who so I'm writing out these detailed descriptions of the tasks that I want done and this method of writing is called uPlan it's spelled with a lowercase U and a capital P and so by writing the uPlan you can then um and you once it's once you have a plan in the uPlan format you get a lot of benefits like being able to uh send the information into other project management systems or redact the uPlan but most importantly the uPlan can be broken into paragraphs and each paragraph is a prompt to the large language model so now you can tell the large language model or the generative AI to complete the tasks for you moreover I'm writing the system to be able to write the uPlan in the first place so what this allows me to do is sit down with Mrs. Wright so Mrs. Wright has some ambition in any particular industry that she's already in and she starts talking and does a voice recording of all the tasks that she wants completed I can then take those tasks that audio file and convert it from voice to text which is how I'm writing this right now and then once all of that text is there I can feed it to a large language model and automatically generate a uPlan to accomplish those tasks so this is very flexible and it can do things like write software and test software and secure software but it can also do things like schedule meetings or go do research for example it can do all the market research for a startup and you just put it in the uPlan and I have a tool that will actually execute the entire uPlan so anything a virtual assistant can do you can get a uPlan to do and I can put it into my special little I-N-TJ robot and it will execute each of those tasks one after the other reliably so I literally built a Mrs. Wright I built a software system robot that can take my tasks and wishes and dreams and aspirations turn it into a plan and as long as the task can be executed by a virtual assistant i.e. over the internet or from inside a laptop if you can imagine that then I can reliably automatically execute tasks another thing that uPlan allows me to do is talk about lots of different concepts I know a lot about a little bit of things or a little bit of about a lot of things and sometimes when I'm talking people have a hard time keeping up with all of the different concepts that I'm tying together now with it being a uPlan I can communicate all of these concepts into the uPlan and basically mind dump into an audio file and then have that file generated in such a way that it can teach other people these concepts and also be able to summarize the uPlan or give more detail and this helps me communicate more clearly so this is a lifestyle thing where essentially I'm saying that I would like to find Mrs. Wright a real human that she and I are ambitious and we build together but we are able to rely on a tool that I built called uPlan where the plan can be automatically written generated and designed and then shown to subject matter experts if we need any kind of validation and then even automatically executed so this way I can help a lady in her career especially if she's in finance or software, IT or even legal or even medical health care anything that has a lot of administrative work a lot of administrative tasks that can be automated or done by a virtual assistant then I can take all of those types of tasks and execute that so that I and this is something that I enjoy doing I enjoy helping people in this way you know brainstorming about an idea and overthinking the idea and getting very detailed and doing lots of research and getting the whole plan together but I admit that I enjoy that part more than the execution part so that's why I built a robot called micromanager that will actually take all of those tasks and execute them in a sequence and this way we can form a dream team we can come up with a bunch of tasks that we want to accomplish try to filter those tasks for what can be automated and then write a comprehensive plan to execute those tasks and refine it get feedback from subject matter experts I'm talking about even be able to do a startup and doing all the market research for the startup and write the code for the startup and actually execute the go-to-market strategy so like a real big thing that would be normally very very difficult but using you plan you basically describe what you want and you can put very detailed prompts in this way you can not only design the plan but you can then take the entire plan and put it into a different large language model a different research system and say what in this plan is wrong what is inaccurate here and give suggestions for corrections of that so that you can even verify that the context is correct and that the concepts are correct and that the large language models fully understand what task should be executed and this tool can be used for planning trips or even planning dates and one of the easiest ways to have a successful relationship is to have shared experiences so Mrs. Wright can put all of her dreams in a to-do list and I can put all of my dreams in the to-do list and there is a way to merge those to-do lists and put them in one file so that we both build and grow together and achieve more than we would individually so I call this concept of being a power couple for dream team for just a cliche idea on the lifestyle that I'm actually looking for looking to actually build and produce things and share and create art with my life partner as opposed to just having someone there for companionship
