      Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness<br> 
      and the progressive realization of worthy goals.<br><br>

      You are what your deep, driving desire is. <br>
      As your desire is, so is your will. <br>
      As your will is, so is your deed. <br>
      As your deed is, so is your destiny.

    <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-circle-notch"></i> 1 THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITY</h2>

    <p>The source of all creation is pure consciousness . . . pure potentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. And when we realize that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power that manifests everything in the universe. </p><br>

    <div class="poem">
    In the beginning
    There was neither existence nor non-existence,
    All this world was unmanifest energy . . .
    The One breathed, without breath, by Its own power
    Nothing else was there . . .</div>

    <blockquote> - Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda</blockquote>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">1.1</span>
      <p>I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent, to just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately thirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">1.2</span>
      <p>I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the sound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of my own silence, and by communing with nature, I will enjoy the life throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">1.3</span>
      <p>I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, "Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs," and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-gift"></i> 2 THE LAW OF GIVING</h2>

    <p>The universe operates through dynamic exchange . . . giving and receiving are different aspects of the flow of energy in the universe. And in our willingness to give that which we seek, we keep the abundance of the universe circulating in our lives. </p>

    <div class="poem">
    This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new. . . .<br>
    Thy infinite gifts come to me only on those very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill. </div>

    <blockquote> — Rabirtdranath Tagore , Gitanjali </blockquote>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">2.1</span>
      <p>Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift may be a compliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come into contact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth and affluence in my life and in the lives of others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">2.2</span>
      <p>Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts of nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers or the first snow of winter. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">2.3</span>
      <p>I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving life most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Each time I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> 3 THE LAW OF "KARMA" OR CAUSE AND EFFECT</h2>

    <div class="poem">
    Every action generates a force of energy 
    that returns to us in like kind . . .<br> 
    what we sow is what we reap.<br>

    And when we choose actions that bring
    happiness and success to others,<br>
    the fruit of our karma is happiness and success.<br>

    Karma is the eternal assertion of human freedom . . .<br>
    Our thoughts, our words, and deeds are the threads of the net which we throw around ourselves. </div>

    <blockquote> — Swami Vivekananda </blockquote>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">3.1</span>
      <p>Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of these choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">3.2</span>
      <p>Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself two questions: "What are the consequences of this choice that I'm making?" and "Will this choice bring fulfillment and happiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">3.3</span>
      <p>I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If the choice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and for all those around me.</p>

    <div class="poem">
    Nature's intelligence functions with effortless ease ... with carefreeness, harmony, and love.
    And when we harness the forces of harmony, joy, and love, we create success and good fortune with effortless ease.
    An integral being knows without going, sees without looking, and accomplishes without doing. </div>

    <blockquote> — Lao Tzu </blockquote>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">4.1</span>
      <p>I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be, because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they are this moment, not as I wish they were.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">4.2</span>
      <p>Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for my situation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that every problem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">4.3</span>
      <p>Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness. I will relinquish the need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others to accept my point of view. I will remain open to all points of view and not be rigidly attached to any one of them.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> 5 THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIRE</h2>

    <div class="poem">
    Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment . . .<br>
    intention and desire in the field of pure potentiality have infinite organizing power.<br><br>

    And when we introduce an intention in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite organizing power to work for us.<br><br>

    In the beginning there was desire, which was the first seed of mind; sages, having meditated in their hearts, have discovered by their wisdom the connection of the existent with the non-existent. </div>

    <blockquote> — The Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda </blockquote>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">5.1</span>
      <p>I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me wherever I go. I will look at this list before I go into my silence and meditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">5.2</span>
      <p>I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan has designs for me much grander than even those that I have conceived.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">5.3</span>
      <p>I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in the present moment.

    <h2 class="icon-heading"><i class="fas fa-walking"></i> 6 THE LAW OF DETACHMENT</h2>

    <div class="poem">
    In detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty . . .<br>
    in the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from our past, from the known, which is the prison of past conditioning.<br><br>

    And in our willingness to step into the unknown, the field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the universe.<br><br>

    Like two golden birds perched on the selfsame tree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell in the same body. The former eats the sweet and sour fruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in detachment. </div>

    <blockquote> — The Mundaka Upanishad </blockquote>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">6.1</span>
      <p>Today I will commit myself to detachment. I will allow myself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participate in everything with detached involvement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">6.2</span>
      <p>Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the problem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be, the more secure will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered">
      <span class="num">6.3</span>
      <p>I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibilities, I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life.</p>
